# Machine learning project: Fastest Lap Prediction from Practice Data
This project is part of **MOD550: Fundaments of Machine Learning for and with Engineering Applications** at the **University of Stavanger**. It uses machine learning techniques to predict the fastest lap times in a race based on practice session data. The goal is to explore how data from Free Practice sessions (FP1, FP2 and FP3) can be used to predict race performance.

## Task 1
* Make a histogram from a 2d random distribution.
* Make a 2d heat map from a 2d random distribution.
* Make a histogram for the source data you selected.
* Convert the histogram into a discrete PMF.
* Calculate the cumulative for each feature.
