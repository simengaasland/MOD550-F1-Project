# MOD550-F1-Project
## Fastest Lap Prediction from Practice Data
This project is part of **MOD550: Fundaments of Machine Learning for and with Engineering Applications** at the **University of Stavanger**. It uses machine learning techniques to predict the fastest lap times in a race based on practice session data. The goal is to explore how data from Free Practice sessions (FP1, FP2 and FP3) can be used to predict the fastest lap in Grand Prix races.
