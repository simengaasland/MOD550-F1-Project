Git repo: it works, good order. A single folder for Task 1 would have been sufficient.

Readme.md: That is good. It misses a bit some info about the author (you!). 

Task 1.1: good

Task 1.2: good, very drammatic colors also :) 

Task 1.3: Nice

Task 1.4: Good! 

Task 1.5: Good!

Comment:
Very nice, bravo.

To get a detailed feedback on your coding style, install pylint. (pip install pylint). Then run it to get your code evaluated (the .py part) and some tips on how to improve (pylint mod_550_project_1.py)
